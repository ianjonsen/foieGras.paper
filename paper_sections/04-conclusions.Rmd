The `foieGras` package was developed to ease fitting state-space models for quality control of animal location data and for inference of behavioural change along animal tracks. We achieve these primarily through a simple yet extensible workflow, model parsimony, and computational speed. Combined, these traits accommodate both novice or occasional and advanced users, and facilitate use in automated, operational quality-assurance/quality-control processes for animal-borne ocean observations \citep{McMahon:2021}. 

The `foieGras` package is an intermediate analysis toolbox where location quality control typically occurs after some initial data processing but prior to any comprehensive, final analysis. In this vein, the move persistence model tools provide a rapid approach for objectively identifying changes in movement behaviour along animal tracks without any required *a priori* knowledge or decisions about the kind or number of behavioural states potentially hidden within the data. Subsequent analysis could entail use of a hidden Markov model to infer potential drivers of observed movements \citep[e.g.,][]{Michelot:2016,McClintock:2018}. Alternatively, move persistence - covariate relationships among multiple individuals can be inferred rapidly in a mixed-effects model framework using the `mpmm` package \citep[][https://github.com/ianjonsen/mpmm]{Jonsen:2019}. 

The `foieGras` package will undergo further development, expanding the range of available SSM's via new movement process models and/or enhanced measurement models for other electronic tracking data types. Additionally, we will seek to enhance integration with other R packages for processing and analysis of animal movement data, where feasible. Feedback from users is invaluable and encouraged. Users may submit bug reports and enhancement suggestions via the foieGras GitHub issues page (https://github.com/ianjonsen/foieGras/issues/new/choose). More general feedback is always welcome by contacting the lead author directly.
