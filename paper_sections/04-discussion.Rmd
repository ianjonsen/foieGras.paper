The estimation speed and simplicity of the SSMs allows them to be fit as part of a fully automated, real-time quality control/quality assurances process [@Jonsen:2020].

- re-routing paths is pragmmatic, not a statistical solution...discuss pitfalls.

- discuss nuances of fit_ssm vs fit_mpm for move persistence estimation & relation of move persistence idea to discete movement states, eg via HMM's 

- touch on applicability of fitting SSM to GLS data ... possibly ok-ish for seabirds but not recommended for fish that spend majority of time at depth. Link is more about how light-level data is converted to location, model-based methods eg WC can yield location likelihoods that are highly non-Gaussian and therefore not amenable to subsequent modelling with `foieGras`. Also touch on fitting a model to output from a model...
