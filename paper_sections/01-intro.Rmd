Animal biotelemetry as a discipline has matured, with telemetry data now virtually essential for understanding behaviour and social interactions, foraging ecology, habitat use and population dynamics of mobile and/or cryptic species. Additionally, the sophistication of current telemetry devices enables the use of animal-borne sensors as a cost-effective approach for observing our planet that compliments more traditional observing platforms [@Kays:2015;@Harcourt:2019;@McMahon:2021]. In all these applications, animal biotelemetry requires rigourous quality control procedures to account for common, though not universally present, data issues such as irregularly timed measurements, sensor biases and location measurement error. Some of these issues may be handled by a manufacturer's on-board or subsequent processing and some must be dealt with by researchers using the data.

State-space models (SSMs) and hidden Markov models (HMMs) are powerful tools for conducting quality control of and making behavioural inference from animal biotelemetry data [@Patterson:2008;@Jonsen:2013]. These are time-series models used across a wide range of research disciplines that estimate the state of an unobserved process from an observed data set. Here, we view an animal's true location and/or behaviour as the unobserved state(s), though many other types of states are possible [e.g., @Schick:2013;@Hooten:2019], and measurements recorded by biotelemetry devices provide the observations. In practical yet simplistic terms, SSMs are usually preferred when the goal is to quality control error-prone location data and estimate parameters of underlying movement process models. HMMs are usually preferred when the goal is to infer behavioural states hidden within biotelemetry data and their drivers, where measurements have negligible error and occur at regular time intervals [but see @McClintock:2018]. Other more technical distinctions and reasons for preferring one of these methods exist [@Jonsen:2013;@Patterson:2017]. Our primary focus here is on SSMs as tools for quality control of error-prone location data. 

A number of R packages such as `moveHMM` [@Michelot:2016], `momentuHMM` [@McClintock:2018], and `swim` [@Whoriskey:2017] provide highly accessible and flexible tools for fitting HMMs to biotelemetry data, and facilitating general inference of animal movement behaviour and its drivers. Similarly, R packages such as `bsam` [@Jonsen:2005], `crawl` [@Johnson:2008], `argosTrack` [@Albertsen:2015], `ctmm` [@Calabrese:2016], and `yaps` [@Baktoft:2017] all provide tools for fitting movement process models in either discrete- or continuous-time, ranging from simple random walks to Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes, in state-space form to various types of animal biotelemetry data. 

The `foieGras`, pronounced "*fwah grah*", package for R [@RCore:2021] was developed to be simple and fast to use, providing SSMs for quality control of error-prone (re)location data collected via the Argos satellite [@Argos:2016;Jonsen:2020] and other telemetry systems, and for inference of changes in behaviour along movement tracks [@Jonsen:2019]. The simplicity of use sets `foieGras` apart from many of the related SSM R packages listed above, yet users can exert control over many aspects of the package functions via optional arguments. This design accommodates both novice and experienced users, and facilitates use in automated, operational quality control workflows [@Jonsen:2020].

Here, we describe the main features of `foieGras` and illustrate its use through a set of examples using Argos and GPS data. Full R code and data for each of the examples is provided in the Supporting Information. Additional details on package functions and their use can be found in their help files and in the package's vignettes.
