#### Code for part 1: Introduction ####

The collection of animal telemetry and bio-logging data has become essential for understanding the movements, behaviour, social interactions, foraging ecology, physiology, habitat use and population dynamics of mobile and/or cryptic species \citep{Kays:2015}. In addition, the sophistication and precision of current technology now enables the use of tagged animals to collect in situ environmental information complimenting data collected from traditional Earth observing platforms \citep{McMahon:2021}. However, in each of these applications, common issues with tracking data such as irregularly timed measurements, sensor biases and location measurement errors must be overcome. 

State-space models (SSMs) are powerful tools for conducting quality control of and making behavioural inference from animal tracking data \citep{Patterson:2008}. Within this framework, an animal’s true location and/or behaviour in the wild are unobserved states, while measurements recorded by animal-borne sensors provide noisy observations. The SSM comprises both a movement process model (e.g., a correlated random walk) and a measurement model that are fit to animal tracks to estimate true location and behaviour states, thereby separating ecologically-meaningful signals from the noise of sensor measurements. 

Here we introduce `aniMotum` (pronounced “*fwah grah*”), a package for fitting SSMs in R \citep{RCore:2021}. This package has two aims: (1) to be a simple and fast implementation of SSMs to quality control error-prone animal location data \citep{Jonsen:2020}; and (2) for inference of changes in movement behaviour along animal tracks \citep{Jonsen:2019}. Although several implementations of SSMs for animal movement data exist, e.g. `bsam` \citep{Jonsen:2005}, `crawl` \citep{Johnson:2008}, and `ctmm` \citep{Calabrese:2016}, their broad utility can be hampered by their user interfaces that tend to be technically complex. `aniMotum` has a more user-friendly implementation suitable for novices, while experienced users can exert control over many aspects of the package functions via optional arguments. 

We describe the main features of `aniMotum` and illustrate its use through a set of applications drawing on Argos and GPS tracking data. Full R code and data for each of the applications is provided in the Supporting Information. Additional details on package functions and usage can be found in the help files and vignettes (\url{https://ianjonsen.github.io/aniMotum/index.html}).
